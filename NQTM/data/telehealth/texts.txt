40 yrs of Big Consult getting it wrong\n\n“In mid 1980s, AT&amp;T hired McKinsey to forecast cell phone adoption in the US by 2020. After racking up a multi million dollar bill, McKinsey said the answer would be 900,000 subscribers.\nThey were off by a factor of 120x.” Tony Seba
It was definately a wink. If it were a twitch she should phone her doctor.
The doctor was working from home, unpaid, on a personal mobile. Patients (many of them elderley, with urgent medical problems) are just not picking up phone calls or responding to text messages, especially from unknown numbers.\n\n“I thought it was spam,” they say, if...\n\n2/3

I forgot what a joy the gym is and listening to people talk on their phone during the whole session. 🙄 Maybe I’ll stay in lockdown. #fitchick #FreedomDay  #sefishturdslearntnothing
I have an IT girl coming today, to help fix my phone, she forgot my appointment last week &amp; was in the midst of painting a wall when l rang her.  If she mucks up this week, ther'll be funny fireworks.
You can try contacting the Department of Health. They have a phone line for queries about seniors. Offer to get a medical certificate from her doctor.\nOtherwise the plan was to open regional from Nov 1 if vaccine numbers are high enough. But that's still 22 days away.\nGood luck.

Getting phone calls at 8pm from your hairdresser to confirm appt on 11th Oct is heart-warming. The excitement in her voice was so good ..
why do i get anxiety about talking to my doctor on the phone than actually speaking in person

Probably an iPhone 13 Pro Max in Gold. The pink iPhone 13 also looks cool. I just need to make an AppleCare+ appointment to discuss if I can trade-in my current phone or if I need to get some repairs/replacement.

So my 5 y.o. has a pediatrician appointment this morning. Only he hasn't. It's a telephone call with my wife. My son doesn't get actually examined as he normally would. How many kids are going to die as a result of this bullshit single-issue lockdown because of this sort of shit?
Ask your doctor though, because EVERYONE is different. I write questions (as I think of them) in the notes section on my phone. Then when I go to the doctors, I ask them all the questions, and read them my list. Otherwise, I forget half of it until I walk out the door

If you have a medical appointment you should have proof of you booking via email or a print out if no smart phone. Most places send confirmations either via post or email. If they don't you can call &amp; get one.
I just got a phone call from Amcal chemist at Waratah. My appointment there for tomorrow morning to get my first jab has been rescheduled for early September. The chemist is having problems with stock levels.
Yup! Similarly in finance and medicine; law. The on-call phone kills staff; or relationships/both
Glad to be back and slowly doing virtual social calls again. ☎️ \n\nAlso my phone will be on flight mode from tonight for 24 hours or so. Experiencing a healing session this afternoon so I’ve been undergoing my day in order to have a clear mind before, during and after. 🌝💭
...2/2 so I'll spend a couple of hrs on phone &amp; take up admin staff time to work this out. I'll have to choose to displace work OR chronic disease management tasks. May miss the appt when I miss a phone call I wasn't expecting - b/c these calls don't come at your appointment time
Proper patient care at risk at so many levels. Even for us boring old chronic disease people - I've already had one text message about an appointment at an LHD site being changed to telephone as a result of increased restrictions, but no info as to which one and when it is ..1/2
Pregnancy month 8 is going well!\nI’ve animorphed into a duck, tried to book an appt for the 33rd of August (?), &amp; to top it off, threw my phone into a skip bin along with a sandwich wrapper. A lovely man (poor unsuspecting soul) climbed in &amp; grabbed it out for me. Happy Friday🤰🏼
Wow. Logged a phone police report today at 4pm using the 1x number. Just had a call and then visit from the local station Seargant &amp; Constable. Photos, finger prints etc done on the kids car after report was emailed to me before they arrived. #efficient thanks 👍 #VicPolice

I provided a printout from my doctor for evidence of the flu shot that also showed my first COVID-19 vaccination. I expect similar would suffice although I’m anticipating phone wallets to hold evidence of vaccinations at some point soon. That would certainly suit a wider usage.
After waiting 20 minutes for my appointment  now coming up to another 20 minutes of the guy trying to get through to the bank on the phone. We are trying not to 👀 each other, listening to the phone ring. Awkward.
So my surgical follow-up on Friday got changed to a phone appointment, which was pushed until 5:30 today. Turns out my pinky should have more movement than it does by now (basically none).\n\nUrgent x-rays tomorrow morning 😬
Hope so too. My area has 3 schools with cases. My doctors are only doing phone consults cause of covid in our area.
terrible telephone service - half hour wait telling me you will get to me soon!  Not good enough trying to cancel an appointment- not waiting anymore!
She was determined not to get AZ and was even against Pfizer.\nOur son has a spinal cord injury and is immune compromised.  We told her that once the rest of our family was vaccinated she would no longer be able to visit him.  She said she would just talk on the phone to him.
Ok social worker called me I’m waiting on an appointment. My family are concerned because I’m getting 5 to 6 calls a day I can’t eat without the phone going off !
Phone appointment with Centrelink tomorrow, probably will ask why I haven't got the medical certificate they asked for two weeks ago at my esat, that's because I could get a gp appointment til Thursday NEXT week.\nMy mutual obligations actually aren't suspended... Lol

Did that twice last week while working on phone with clients.  Strangers too. Looked up closest clinic via online booking system.  Gave them phone no of clinic,  the appt times available.  They were older Vaxx hesitant but since cluster wanted vaxx.  There's complexity out there

I *probably* have a phone appointment with my DES consultant today. I say probably because I did get text to say I had no mutual obligations (her office is on the central coast but she does outreach to the Toronto site) but I also got a reminder.\nI'll answer the phone.\n#80aDay
Yes, I did.  And I would gladly go &amp; have it if I could get an appointment, or see updated available dates on the webpage or get through on the phone.  But alas, no. 🤷‍♀️
My GP doesn't do vaccinations. I eventually found a nearbycractice that do. Phone contact impossible so I went there in person  Got appointment for next day. 2nd shot AZ booked August. Will seek a Pfizer booster thereafter.
I don't have job search requirements so I'll just report as usual. I was already going to have a phone appointment Thursday
I said how I only received a phone call the night prior asking why I hadn’t attended my appointment and went on to indicate how I hadn’t received the appointment notification… 32/n

But you can check walk-in wait times on-line and if ok go down . So it’s not like the phone is the only way to get a place. Effectively a walk in with known wait time is almost same as an appointment. Just can’t plan days ahead
Argh how frustrating! Phone lines have been swamped and crashing. Hang in there - having an appointment is better than just turning up and waiting for hours standing in the cold I guess 🥶  Hopefully phone capacity can be sorted soon 👍 need better hold music 🎶 😂

Did you manage to get an appointment Spencer, or just walk-up? I got stuck on hold on the appointment phone line.

I was once told by a critical care doctor, when I’d recorded 320 phone calls over a weekend, that “we don’t care about waking you up; you’re on call, it’s your job”.\n\nSleep inertia is a barrier to good decision making. Courtesy is key, and patient safety must prevail.

My age group started last week but the doctor’s office doesn’t have any vaccine yet. They just say to phone back in a week or two.
So irritating Mary, no one can fit me in until after Easter AND on a phone consult with my Doctor he told me I probably have a common cold! “There’s nothing common about this cold, I can assure you!” I replied 😂
I phoned the National Covid phone number to clarify whether it’s an opt in system that requires people to make their own appointment or wait to be contacted. They confirmed that people have to make their own appt. For assistance, the website lists the National Relay Service.

Yes I understand this 😰 I used to go and sit in the park when I had phone counselling through my work. I did it in my lunch break
Can they not run a face to face session by Zoom? Maybe no because kind of same as phone call but could you be in your room for it?
My doctor accepted a 3:30pm phone consult and said to get tested last time. Drive thru said nope to under 5. Local walk-in clinic closed around 4pm already. cbf waiting 3+ hours at a hospital to get a test. Got tested at the local clinic 830am next day. Negative day after.

Even the proposed increase in #jobseeker wouldn’t cover my rent! So what about utilities (excluding a/c) phone, internet, car rego, servicing, petrol, doctors, medicine, food? You know the bare necessities to get a job. Forget clothes, social activities and mental health!
I have 'Simple Calendar Widget' on my Android home screen, it shows my next upcoming calendar appointment. Which I see most times I open my phone.
Today I’ve had a phone meeting with my accountant, prepared some new marketing material for insta/OnlyFans and now I’m training... someone call a doctor I think I’m sick
This phone is chewing through the power more and more each day. It’s not that i shouldn’t be using my dilated eyes but that I am now on low-power mode (and waiting for doctor who is usually quite long, and probs moreso without an appointment)

Dear #ENDIAstudy colleagues, could someone please send the zoom link to this afternoon’s symposium session to my phone...not moving from here, but happy to join the call ☺️
Virtual CNY eve reunion dinner is basically transferring all those awkward silences onto the phone screen.\nThink I only spoke 3 times &amp; the entire video chat session only lasted 15 mins tops.\nWas slightly ambushed as I didn’t expect the call but it was good to see them all again.
AMS Redfern? They'll urge you to phone consult anyway.
Yes I agree, I joined and all I get these days us emails asking me to donate. No consultation,  invitation to branch meetings. I did get a phone call from a desperate state local member trying to get me to join her branch rather than the closest branch.
My favourite kind of monitoring visit - by phone and over in under a minute. 🥳
Yesterday, I didn’t leave my bed. I had an appointment with the GP over the phone, from my bed. Then I slept. And slept. And slept.
The GP registrar it took 7 days to get an "emergency" appointment with made 2 phone calls and got me correct treatment within an hour 🥰\nI'm in love!\nShame the ED visit, and a call then 8hr round trip to my oral surgeon didn't help this 15 days of agony🙄\n🤞For sleep🤞
Wonder if I'll have to call bc they forgot to ring or they'll call me. 6mins until phone appointment
I got the pros to install at my clinic ... once I am happy with them I will get more.  I can link heaps of them (one in each consult room / waiting area etc) and link them all to a reporting base wit which will report to my phone \n\nWe have applied to be a SAFE vaccination centre!

She then stands there on her phone looking for her confirmation because she thinks we have shown up without a booking (which we hadn’t). Two minutes later she walks out with her head hung low after her booking confirmation shows her appointment is actually for tomorrow. 2/2

My local Telstra shop can't be reached by phone. It either doesn't work or is always engaged. So it's necessary to go to \nthe shop to make an appointment. Waiting times are hours long. They are nice, but I've been 5 or 6 times and still have the same problem. What's the problem?
Our village Dafni is filled with all my great aunts &amp; uncles. I try to visit every summer b/c I need to see them all. Today my phone showed me this meal from Dafni, eaten with my great uncle Pavlo’s wine (I spend all year dreaming about the wine). I miss this so very painfully.
Hey  if I selected option 3, some eager customer will not know their appointment was cancelled bc the phone number/details were wrong. How is your customer going to know you had it wrong and what the correct details are? I feel bad for this person in Blackburn VIC!
I've had 4 shoulder ops in 40 years, 2 in my 20's, a knee replacement at age 60 in June. The doctor who spent the most amount of time with me, explained everything while awake and then checking on me post op in ward, &amp; by phone wad the anaesthetist. Last one went above and beyond

After hrs &amp; hrs with Telstra toing and froing on-line (phone calls are verboten), it has come to this. There is a 92yo man in the house &amp; if his wife goes out with the sketchy mobile he cannot phone an ambulance. Doctor has to get involved now because they can’t offer a service.

💯 I am still not sure if we should do anything at all and our state is **clear**\n it doesn’t feel right in a way I think it should be subdued minimal or people that you regularly see that’s it don’t visit your grandmother call her on the phone. Now.
day just had to be ruined by the doctor giving bad news over the phone 😭
I saved this bathroom on my phone years ago.. i will visit this place soon #manifesting
People feel invisible when they feel forgotten. \n\nEvery culture is at its' core, SOCIAL. But social is not a phone or a platform. It's an activity that requires you to call, visit, pick up (groceries) for people who can't pick them up themselves. \n\nTo be social is to be HUMAN.

How are the doctors late for a phone consult ?!
I don’t understand the point of having a doctors appointment over the phone, if I have to still go and pick up my medical certificate?
Yes, it’s not an easy feeling mingling in hospitals when there’s lurgy about. I’m always glad for a Telehealth consultation. I haven’t seen the GP in many months. Had about a dozen phone calls I reckon. Hope they keep it going. Have a good chat tomoz.\nDon’t forget to listen. 😂😂
Too early for a busy day!\nSecond half of centre for psychotherapy assessment, a phone interview with  for a capacity assessment and back to town this Arvo for my 7suap therapy session. ☔🌦️
OMG, wtf is it with drs acting like a phone appt isn't an actual appt and can just be put off as long as they bloody well please?? 😤\n\nThe longest I've waited was an hour and 45min!! I couldn't even go to the loo, cuz they kept telling me (I kept calling) "you're next" 😡
So my doctors is now by phone appointment first, something I didn’t know about at the start of the week when I was ill. Tried to do a walk in today but had to make phone appointment, I now have a phone appointment tomorrow between 9-10am. More #COVIDVIC19 hassle
It’s ok, don’t blame Doc, she doesn’t work on Sat. \nOnly did tests 2.30pm Fri, Nurse called me when they got results 1pm Sat, to request to make appointment with Doc, they’re not allowed to tell you negative results over phone. \nBeen here before, I’ll be ok 👍💜
I don’t like interacting with telemarketers or “jumping on a quick call” when someone is trying to make a sales pitch. I’m able to talk fine on the phone to friends and family. I can manage making an appointment over the phone but often resist for a long time. 😆

An anonymous job service provider sends a message to my wife saying she missed a phone appointment.?? And payments are now on hold?? Her phone was not switched on, and no prior warning of an upcoming appointment. Wait until this is repeated by many thousands. And many are cut off
I get phone calls to my practice to complain about the attitudes of “that woman” (me) and when the complainer asks to be put through to the person in charge they get put through to me (medical director) and they say “oh sorry, I didn’t realise you were a doctor” surprise!
It took 4 years for my wife to finally having enough of me not scheduling a diagnosis appointment to say fuck it, picking up the phone and making an appointment right there and then.

But the doctor doing the test (they were ID as a doctor) told me exactly what would happen next:\n- you will get a text very shortly\n- if you are positive, you’ll receive a phone call. The call will say it’s from the DHHS on your screen. Important you answer it bc they will help.

We were on phone with them for hours and call was transferred to 4-5 people. Then finally we are told to go and visit store to exchange phone. Let’s see what happens tomorrow

RUOK is some corporate bullshit. If I said “no I’m not” they’d refer me to a phone number for 5 counselling sessions with some guy over the phone, whilst still maintaining every expectation for me. It’s a box ticking exercise, get lost with that shit
I just want a needle in my neck to give me some pain relief. Had a neuro phone consult. Waste of time and money. Now referred to another one. They better come up with a way to get rid of the pain or I'll probably just keep popping pills. Wheres that weed oil at?

My GP does most of consult by phone with patient outside in car. Only go in at last minute for physical part. Otherwise telehealth. NO patients in waiting room. GP wears scrubs &amp; mask. Minimal risk. Rheumy, endo, gastro specialists all doing telehealth where possible.
Bitches callin' my phone like I'm locked up, nonstop\nFrom the plane to the fuckin' helicopter, yeah\nCops pullin' up like I'm givin' drugs out, nah, nah\nI'm a popstar, not a doctor.
Mansplaining doctor, on a topic nothing to with his field ...🙄 \n\nNearly had to throw out my phone, the patronising,  know-it-all crap was oozing though it \n💜😂😋
But ... this it the emergency appointment.  My normal appointment was 3 weeks ago. I only spoke with cardiologist. An administrative matter (a referral) is normally managed at reception. Now my GP has to do an emergency phone consult with me, so I can have an emergency cardiac
‘Getting referrals is patient’s responsibility’. \nI have now been refused my phone appointment because the Cardiologist’s PA didn’t tell me on Monday or Tuesday despite 3 phone calls and 2 emails that I required one. I would have had 36 hrs to see my GP and get a referral.
What website do you visit the most? — Twitter and instagram and maybe Facebook for 5 minutes but I try not be on my phone or laptop to much
Absolutely worth a phone call or a visit. Some do specialise. Check out web pages. They dont have any Jobactive type arrangements with the government.
When I’m dreaming (like, asleep dreaming) the phone in the dream is always one of two old Nokia’s I had at 14 and 20. It’s nice my brain brings them to visit me, I guess? lol
Equally the emergency physician on-call after a fatiguing evening shift just dropped off to sleep when the phone rings 😂
The first lecture I was giving this semester we had a power blackout at out house. Backup plan zoom session off a hotspot on the phone for as long as the battery lasts on the laptop. Very surreal! Very 2020

Fabulous telehealth consult with my GP today. She was just as warm, thorough and helpful on the phone as in person. We discussed when I need in person consults and when telehealth is just fine. Person centred primary care.
Off to enjoy a phone chat with a client who's booked in a week's worth of sessions after lockdown, connecting before actual booking for me creates a more intense session 💗... Sorry only he gets to see underneath 💋
Should have gone 2 your local council used take 2 mins for paper work 5/10 min wait for all the people in front to get jab. Was quicker then getting into the footy! Just part of the GPs visit now days one phone call to let them know I would like one at regular app. Always free
Ok but like which phone case... I have to be able to have it on my phone while at work so it has to be appropriate so sadly I can’t get the medicine one I saw
Mum told me on the phone today that Doctor Bloomfield has become a cult sex symbol in NZ. I don't know if it's true, or if it's just my mum that fancies him. Any ladies in NZ care to confirm/deny?

I offer a phone chat session where it's $30 for half hour. Gives plenty time to hear my voice and hear that I am as authentic in real as I am online and thru my business\n\nI won't do free phone calls as mostly I've found they are not legitimate in their word in booking.
Due to Victoria's stage 4 lockdown/curfew, our personal trainer, Jared Adams can't come to us, or we to him. So we came up with a technological solution involving What's App, a phone and a tripod. We felt proper buggered after the session, so it seems to have worked correctly.
In case you haven’t worked it out yet, the covidsafe app is a FAILURE. That’s why every shop or dining establishment you visit gets you to sign in or scan a QR code, to track you still. Use fake names or phone numbers and don’t let them track you. Pretty simple!
Anyway, its pretty rude of myself to have a phone appointment at 3pm when the oilers game will no doubt be in its closing stages 😭

I found these photos on my phone tonight. Jack’s visit to Australia. #sydney
i remember literally every session was maybe 40 mins and she’d be on the phone for about 25 of it and then be like so if it’s not a relationship or a friendship that you’re sad about... what is it? like bruh that’s y i am here
I reli don’t know how  get 3.9 rates🤔🤔 I made an appointment at 5:45 pm today and wait for almost 30mins without anyone coming. P.S. there is no receptionist at door 😫😫 Reli disappointed and I couldn’t vote on google thru my phone. Strongly not recommended 👎👎
you’ve done it again. #Floptus I’ve tried to assist setting up my mums home phone for a month now. You cancelled her nbn setup visit and still haven’t contacted her after a week and now send her another nbn box. You guys are the worst for customer service.
To get told your results over the phone costs $40 from a doctor. Y’all are thieves. Good thing you can claim shit back from Medicare.

I happened to ask this question to Gideon Haigh and Peter Lalol at a Q&amp;A session of an event at SCG. (They didn't allow this to be recorded on the phone that year). Gideon &amp; Peter gave this response:\n\n
Waiting for ParentsNext mandatory phone call appointment from a person with 3 less degrees than me, (but who also has the ability to make me virtually homeless) feels deeply ignominious.
Hi. My Mum and sister have both been tested. Referred by GP. Done at pathology clinic. Results delivered by doctor via phone call within 48 hrs. Both negative. 😀
Can you get a Telehealth appointment by Monday? They might order bloods over the phone, and you’ll have the results by your appointment on Monday.
I remember in college 2010, i was going 2 visit a guy, was on a motobike, and he called me 2 know if i was close, on recieving the call, my phone disappeared n my hands were still in my ears acting as if i was still on call. The thing shock me. Till today not sure how it happened
GPs are adapting to this. Which is why using good online platforms is so much better than just a telephone consultation
I’ve had SOS cell phone reception in all but a two-meter radius from the front window for most of today. I’m relying on a single bar of 3G reception. Telehealth appointment could not be done via video. Even as audio only, I lost connection several times and had to be called back.

Just found I have an appointment tomorrow wasn't even told just had it in an inbox. It says the address but last couple months I've done phone appointments. I called &amp; they said straight away it's phone. K better be bc I don't wanna be having to rush into Penrith.
I'd  add this experience\nMiss an appointment they didn't know they had \nPhone to fix it wait hours on hold only to be hung up on by centrelink call line over and over \nFinally get thru to be told u missed an appointment so ur payments be cut off.
My sister is 64 on JobSeeker. Last week #SarinoRusso started pressuring her 2 return 2 volunteering. She's been bac 4 three weeks as soon as it was legal to do so. They send a text &amp; say "you've a phone appointment in 3 hours. Be at your computer or be cut off" They r vultures

Why did  make an 8-hour visit to #Jerusalem instead of just picking up the phone? The answer is exceptional American diplomatic timing. #Israel
No jobseeker payment here. Approved for it but has never eventuated. Mygov a/c gives a date &amp; amount which always changes to the next day. Going to visit centrelink today as there’s no assistance via phone. Wish me luck 😷
You may understand my own amazement when I say the best thing to happen to me today was a phone call today from my hair dresser offering me an appointment. Never thought I’d be so happy. Good to hear  #minkhairandbody on Royal Parade are preparing to re-open
I've only been able to visit once, for an hour. Not much time to chat with staff. Convos with RNs were by phone.
No need for nerves in the end, the clinic I was meant to get the jab at told me and another bloke to turn up at 4 when they close at 3\n\nThe kicker is a car was in the doctor’s carpark but nobody was answering the door or phone
Just wanted 2say a BIG thank you 4the phone call from the lovely Brie. I’m still house hunting &amp;she totally understood that coming in for an appointment then undoing it all by all of this running around would be a waste. I’ll be in touch soon👌🏻
Looking to change obstetricians. Really getting too overwhelming. Respect goes both ways. Being on phone calls in our appointment and wanting to get wife out the door. It’s just not acceptable. Making to feel like a burden on them. Ridiculous
Had one of those socially distancing vet appointments today - we stay outside whilst consultation goes on inside with dog, and over the phone. Wonder if vets will ever want pet owners in their clinics again after #Covid_19australia Dog came out v happy, assume bcoz of many treats
Sorry couldn’t be of assistance today Brother Bob. Went to visit a friend and didn’t touch my phone for the entire day. Rarity for me I know. Hope you had a great Sunday pal. 👍

Just falling in love with the hot doctor over the phone during iso
Agree. For example many GPs doing phone only consults at the moment. Miss so much when can’t see patient. e.g patient with mild Bells Palsy. Avoidable ED visit. Unnecessary risk and cost to system and patient (time, travel) So barriers need to be explored and solved.
Having a phone consult with my GP shortly and I'm sad about missing the bit when she turns and looks into my soul and asks me how I am like she really wants to know.

I don’t think so, and if you don’t take your phone with you when you go out then there’s not much value in the app anyway (other than when people visit you)
✅ Our phones store much more personal details now - Who we call, where we go, what sites we visit. And why? zero health or other benefit to the owner of the phone. This app is less intrusive and aimed purely at our health. Simple choice: decline the app means choose to stay home

Had my first appointment with my new GP on the phone and it was quite good. He was attentive and interested in my condition and already referred me to a specialist. A professor even.
AIPA Chair and Strategy Group member, Tania Dalton (Jones) highlights phone/online counselling is available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and mental health practitioners need to practice to a culturally safe standard to ensure therapeutic support is delivered.
You're right, though I would struggle with a phone appointment because somehow phone calls make me more anxious than face to face conversations.
I haven't been tested because there's no need to. If I feel ill then I definitely will. I can have an visual appointment with my Dr on my phone. All good

Phone or Skype consult. Previously not billable to medicare but now can. Great where no physical intervention is required which is common in a GP consult.
Call your GP or specialist to book an appointment as normal. It will then be scheduled take place by phone or video depending on your resources and if it can actually be done remotely (e.g. not a blood test or something)
Absolutely. If brief phone counselling simply refers to state-based services already at capacity, it will not help. More funding to assist in employing caseworkers on the ground in communities who can navigate housing, legal and medical solutions is necessary #dfv #COVID19Aus
It will not cost Govt a cent more for HMR to go to telephone consult. I am not asking for this format forever. We have VERY vulnerable patients needing a voice of reason in their lives right now
Sounds good in theory. I feel very sceptical any Doctor could correctly diagnose my health through me talking alone on a mobile phone m.
With the greatest of respect, more ‘phone counselling’ for #dfv won’t cut it. If all they can do is a brief counselling session and then refer on to other frontline services that are already at capacity, women &amp; kids will be stuck in an endless loop. #dfv

I was chatting to a guy on the phone today, he’s 68 and has essentially no immune system and he’s planning on going to the shops this week. I said stay home, his brother said stay home and his career said stay home, but he’s waiting to hear what the doctor reckons 🙄🤬

Yes. Not all flu is COVID19. Stay at home - self isolate. Only contact helpline / GP / physician over the phone. If symptoms worsen after 3-5 days then contact doc to arrange for testing.
I finished my jobseeker claim up until the part where I have to book a phone appointment but the website was not allowing me to. What can you help me with there?
I did and they told me I can do a phone consultation.  The Doctor will phone me around my appointment time. That makes me feel better.
Some appreciated feedback. Mind you this session was by phone 📲 . Pls know we are still in operation and taking all measures to ensure a sanitized working environment. Skypes / Zooms / phone sessions continue to be in operation 🙏🏻\n#healers #melbournehealers #wedothework

If unsure phone your doctor 1st.\nGet yourself tested if they do that easily in Scotland. \nIf that 12 days is physical isolation another 2 days isolation won't hurt.\nLook, just talkl to your doctor and remember hand and cough hygiene. \n\nGood luck.

Being socially responsible won't feed your kid.\nI think the Government needs to seriously look at that. At least have some amnesty where you can phone doctor and your GP with questioning can then issue something to employer AND that has to be on medicare, no gap.

your Cairns Officeworks never pick the phone it’s a 3rd day in a row, I can’t visit them. Is there any way to speak your customer service regarding invoice.
Fabulous news. Does your doctor not pick up the phone these days?
Yep, this has been our typical experience as well. Worst still are University counselling centres that insist on calling you when booking appointments. Like phone phobia is one of the reasons for needing an appointment in the first place!
I have an ap on my phone called qoctor which is a service set up by doctors in Aus who will do a consultation via video Skype and provide a med cert. they are strict &amp; refund fee if they do not believe you or they believe it's imperative you get to a medical centre instead.
Just had probably the loveliest phone chat with a new client. Wanting to book a specific session with me. \nAnd I also love he wants to pop his virginity with a mature woman who knows how to love a man. His words. He's done his homework brownie points. \nMy yoni wetter if possible
Uh oh... caught looking at my phone again! But was a great session thanks  and team
IME there's no ongoing advice nor support.\nI learnt online as best I could, by reading neuroscience &amp; those PLWD who write. No public services, no health care planning, no enablement. Maybe phone counselling, if you're lucky- in office hours only. At the mercy of providers.
BAHAHAHHAHAAHA!! And when you pick up the phone to make a call you can hear the transmission noise during active session on the net 😂😂 and especially when you’re on msn you know the connection goes off when the little green emoji spins! Dinosaur days 😂
My doctor said if you want it to work take it at least an hour before bed but make sure you body is winding down so it can take it's affect. Like I shower and lay in the dark straight after with my phone brightness all the way down. Then no technology so my brain knows it's bed.
The referring doctor was told it was an inappropriate ED referral which was met with ‘well, they’re on their way’ and the phone being hung up 3/5
12 employees standing around doing nothing and only two customers in the store, yet could only ask about one thing per appointment WTF SO PISSED OFF! Told to make another appointment to discuss my phone.
rang yesterday about a SIM tray, told to go in today. Went, told they need to be ordered! Could have told me that when l rang yesterday! Wanted to ask about a problem with a phone and he said that another appointment would have to be made for that🤬
Experts tell u to put the phone down before bed if you can’t sleep but I’m productively omw to snooze fest just scrolling thru endless twitter bs as my eyelids are heavier than my first ever counselling session in 2016
Got an idea how to provide reliable telephone services when the old copper lines have been abandoned in favour of NBN services?\n\n
You don’t need a CT scan for a fever. I suggest you get on the phone to your doctor back in Belgium.
Incredible that I can take out a home loan from my phone but can’t make an appointment without something being faxed! 😳
Trying to organise a scan at the hospital and the woman on the other end of the phone told me she couldn’t help me unless I “faxed the request” - I couldn’t help replying w “well it’s not 1988 so I don’t have a fax” She wasn’t impressed 😬 meanwhile I still don’t have an appt.
In independent fee for service practice the idea is for the first contact, be it by phone, email, or sms, to result in a kept first appointment.
And then she said my mum wasn’t answering her phone (she was at a hospital appointment with my stepdad) and I said I couldn’t give her my dads number bc he was out of the country for work and she threatens to suspend me 🤪
Phone early when making your appointment.  They need time to organise the men in the white coats
To be honest there is enough pressure on NICU mums and adding this to it seems stupid. I understand the principle I suppose but it’s all about balance. We have parents who don’t visit their kids and so a cuddle with them staring at a phone is better than not.
Another goal for me too. I’m lazy and love the convenience of my phone 😉

I need to cancel an appointment for today as I am unwell, but I cannot reach you. Is there an email address or alternate phone number I can use?
So every time I visit my Uncle Guenter (80yo), there's a list of tasks that need doing. One of them is always deleting people from his mobile phone who've died :/
Been looking after mum with no break since dad died almost 2 y ago . She has dementia, breast cancer, ( more imaging this week) and arthritic knees so she’s wobbly on her feet. She has 3 daughters, 5 granddaughters, they don’t phone they don’t visit. Patriarchy?
I got there only to realise she had cancelled. She tried to call me but my phone must be playing up because I didn’t get any calls. So I went all the way there for an appointment I didn’t even have. Oh and I won’t be able to get in for ages.

Hold on... Wait a minute... Hold the phone... it gets worse because apparently that’s possible. This session was even more inaccessible than the last one. One of the exercises involved looking at pictures. I kid you not. Fucking. Pictures.
Sorry to say as a consultant trying to call a consultant yesterday got told they don't carry a pager or phone, then after that got told he was uncontactable. Nothing to see, Just a doctor post OD. I give up.

Just about everyone I know my Doctor my support workers my psychiatrist they all say that I should write a book like you said in your last week it would probably be a best seller They say I should record myself on my phone or something else. Then take it a publisher and will help

No, just lost mine :-( they were paired against different people. You can't delete a phone without a keycard and can't delete a keycard without the list key card. Major security fail. I'm waiting a week for a callback for a USB cable. I bet this ends in SC visit.

I'm in QLD but my phone updated itself overnight for NSW daylight savings. I think maybe I hate everything now? Going to NSW for lunch after an appt this morning in QLD is black diamond level difficulty.

I can remember the pre-internet BBS era before ISP's (1980's). You didn't visit a website by google searching, you dialled up each one individually from their phone numbers printed in a magazine! There was only one here in Albury too lol. I'm so old...
Must you continually ejaculate such excrement! Put your phone down Don, or use it to call a good doctor...
Love to just...not be called by the phone counselling service as scheduled 🙃 luckily I have a psychologist appointment tomorrow! Things are a bit rough right now. Leaving “mid-semester” break until 10 weeks in is not cool, ACU! I need a rest!
Actually I agree!  Get most annoyed when prompt adhoc service is demanded 4 routine care usually needing appt &amp; they think its our job to call GP etc  for info (nope. "Here's a phone, tell practice nurse to fax to xxxx xxxx") or arrange authority scripts
WOW... assuming the official watchdog will be issued with a tin foil hat as part of uniform on appointment, and a telephone hotline to the IPA to “validate” what the required politically scientific validated answer is.

This person had never had any experience working with blind people and she told me I was her first one. She didn’t even know what a screen reader was. Halfway through the session, my phone started ringing.

Q1 - an action taken that I can see or measure - example if I get a phone call , or an email or a visit to a website that I can directly tie to the printed piece - a tweet or social mention counts too  #PrintChat
I get sad every time I add my weight and body fat into my phone and it keeps reminding me of how little progress I've made and how far away from my goal I am. Apparently I'm also obese according to BMI. My doctor told me that I'm not obese and BMI is useless. Who to believe!?
So the M’sian doctor at the ED saw mine &amp; Joyce’s (next of kin) phone number then said:\nWah your parents allow you 2 to have so many 4s in your phone number?\n\nI replied: this is Australia, Chinese superstition don’t work here!\n\nHe responded: that’s exactly what I told my parents.
My doctor is excellent, but to prescribe Panadeine Forte he has to get permission by phone from bureaucrats in Canberra, which is offensive. OTC Mersyndol worked better with far less codeine content but now of course you can't get it(on the PBS), forcing people into heavier stuff
Feel like I'm getting back into my Twitter stride for the first time in a while, I know that I'm doing well because Twitter keeps freezing on me 😂\n\nSo for those not at #AWSCommunity, while my fingers and phone can keep up I'll be live tweeting whatever session I'm in!
Why didn't they just X-ray on the spot? When I finally went to a family doctor he ordered an immediate x-ray and ten minutes later he did a telephone referral to a surgeon while we admired the picture of my mangled bone.

I can’t get my head around how this is legal, when there is supposed to be confidentiality within the doctor/nurse, patient relationship. I’m not even allowed to share information about my patients over the phone, unless I know for sure I’m speaking to a parent or legal guardian.
Don’t you have a telephone triage service you can call instead of just going to ED? A physio might be helpful in your case*\n*usual caveats about health advice via internet from a health professional who dies not have a therapeutic relationship with you.
I have considered changing my phone number but I didn’t because that’s a massive pain in the arse. When I blocked their numbers, mum followed me to an appointment and said she would stalk me to the ends of the earth. Those were her exact words
The amount of times my co worker has said "No, we can't give you a dental voucher but we can book you in for an emergency dental appointment" on this 7min phone call is insane \n\n🤣🤣🤣

Phone calls are a huge source of anxiety for me. I think it's because I can't see the person's face+ body language so I can't judge reactions. I much prefer to speak in person than call, even to make a dentist appointment. Took me YEARS of ptractice to be able to make calls

40 yrs of Big Consult getting it wrong\n\n“In mid 1980s, AT&amp;T hired McKinsey to forecast cell phone adoption in the US by 2020. After racking up a multi million dollar bill, McKinsey said the answer would be 900,000 subscribers.\nThey were off by a factor of 120x.” Tony Seba
It was definately a wink. If it were a twitch she should phone her doctor.

You can try contacting the Department of Health. They have a phone line for queries about seniors. Offer to get a medical certificate from her doctor.\nOtherwise the plan was to open regional from Nov 1 if vaccine numbers are high enough. But that's still 22 days away.\nGood luck.

Getting phone calls at 8pm from your hairdresser to confirm appt on 11th Oct is heart-warming. The excitement in her voice was so good ..

So my 5 y.o. has a pediatrician appointment this morning. Only he hasn't. It's a telephone call with my wife. My son doesn't get actually examined as he normally would. How many kids are going to die as a result of this bullshit single-issue lockdown because of this sort of shit?
Ask your doctor though, because EVERYONE is different. I write questions (as I think of them) in the notes section on my phone. Then when I go to the doctors, I ask them all the questions, and read them my list. Otherwise, I forget half of it until I walk out the door

I just got a phone call from Amcal chemist at Waratah. My appointment there for tomorrow morning to get my first jab has been rescheduled for early September. The chemist is having problems with stock levels.
Yup! Similarly in finance and medicine; law. The on-call phone kills staff; or relationships/both
Glad to be back and slowly doing virtual social calls again. ☎️ \n\nAlso my phone will be on flight mode from tonight for 24 hours or so. Experiencing a healing session this afternoon so I’ve been undergoing my day in order to have a clear mind before, during and after. 🌝💭
...2/2 so I'll spend a couple of hrs on phone &amp; take up admin staff time to work this out. I'll have to choose to displace work OR chronic disease management tasks. May miss the appt when I miss a phone call I wasn't expecting - b/c these calls don't come at your appointment time
Proper patient care at risk at so many levels. Even for us boring old chronic disease people - I've already had one text message about an appointment at an LHD site being changed to telephone as a result of increased restrictions, but no info as to which one and when it is ..1/2
Pregnancy month 8 is going well!\nI’ve animorphed into a duck, tried to book an appt for the 33rd of August (?), &amp; to top it off, threw my phone into a skip bin along with a sandwich wrapper. A lovely man (poor unsuspecting soul) climbed in &amp; grabbed it out for me. Happy Friday🤰🏼
Wow. Logged a phone police report today at 4pm using the 1x number. Just had a call and then visit from the local station Seargant &amp; Constable. Photos, finger prints etc done on the kids car after report was emailed to me before they arrived. #efficient thanks 👍 #VicPolice

I provided a printout from my doctor for evidence of the flu shot that also showed my first COVID-19 vaccination. I expect similar would suffice although I’m anticipating phone wallets to hold evidence of vaccinations at some point soon. That would certainly suit a wider usage.
After waiting 20 minutes for my appointment  now coming up to another 20 minutes of the guy trying to get through to the bank on the phone. We are trying not to 👀 each other, listening to the phone ring. Awkward.
So my surgical follow-up on Friday got changed to a phone appointment, which was pushed until 5:30 today. Turns out my pinky should have more movement than it does by now (basically none).\n\nUrgent x-rays tomorrow morning 😬
Hope so too. My area has 3 schools with cases. My doctors are only doing phone consults cause of covid in our area.
terrible telephone service - half hour wait telling me you will get to me soon!  Not good enough trying to cancel an appointment- not waiting anymore!
She was determined not to get AZ and was even against Pfizer.\nOur son has a spinal cord injury and is immune compromised.  We told her that once the rest of our family was vaccinated she would no longer be able to visit him.  She said she would just talk on the phone to him.
Ok social worker called me I’m waiting on an appointment. My family are concerned because I’m getting 5 to 6 calls a day I can’t eat without the phone going off !
Phone appointment with Centrelink tomorrow, probably will ask why I haven't got the medical certificate they asked for two weeks ago at my esat, that's because I could get a gp appointment til Thursday NEXT week.\nMy mutual obligations actually aren't suspended... Lol

#abcnews Grandson 2yr of Paramedic degree, can't do placement in Aged Care until vaccinated. Spent morning on phone  to seek an appt.None avail. until 29th July. No stocks of Pfizer on hand. Hatred of this Gov grows exponentially day by day. #COVID19
Did that twice last week while working on phone with clients.  Strangers too. Looked up closest clinic via online booking system.  Gave them phone no of clinic,  the appt times available.  They were older Vaxx hesitant but since cluster wanted vaxx.  There's complexity out there
Update: phone call received 750am this morning \nInfusion lounge staff: where are you, your infusion appointment was at 0730 this morning \nMe: 🤦‍♀️. [Summary = please check clinical notes from last immunologist appoint]\nInfusion lounge: OK. We'll call you back

I *probably* have a phone appointment with my DES consultant today. I say probably because I did get text to say I had no mutual obligations (her office is on the central coast but she does outreach to the Toronto site) but I also got a reminder.\nI'll answer the phone.\n#80aDay
Yes, I did.  And I would gladly go &amp; have it if I could get an appointment, or see updated available dates on the webpage or get through on the phone.  But alas, no. 🤷‍♀️
My GP doesn't do vaccinations. I eventually found a nearbycractice that do. Phone contact impossible so I went there in person  Got appointment for next day. 2nd shot AZ booked August. Will seek a Pfizer booster thereafter.
I don't have job search requirements so I'll just report as usual. I was already going to have a phone appointment Thursday
I said how I only received a phone call the night prior asking why I hadn’t attended my appointment and went on to indicate how I hadn’t received the appointment notification… 32/n

I've had a medical appointment booked for 5 months wait list, it is due tomorrow, so it's now become a phone call.  What a disgrace.
Took quite a bit to get through on the phone but having an appointment meant in and out within half an hour! Feeling incredibly lucky and very grateful right now  #jabdone #COVID19Vic
After 42 attempts and a combined 2hr 9min on hold, I have a vaccination appointment 😊\n\nIf you're suffering the same frustration as I was, keep trying, you'll get through eventually.\n\nAlso, be kind to the person at the other end of the phone when you do get through.

But you can check walk-in wait times on-line and if ok go down . So it’s not like the phone is the only way to get a place. Effectively a walk in with known wait time is almost same as an appointment. Just can’t plan days ahead
Argh how frustrating! Phone lines have been swamped and crashing. Hang in there - having an appointment is better than just turning up and waiting for hours standing in the cold I guess 🥶  Hopefully phone capacity can be sorted soon 👍 need better hold music 🎶 😂

Did you manage to get an appointment Spencer, or just walk-up? I got stuck on hold on the appointment phone line.
Please ring the vaccine number to get an appointment. Ok. Please have a system and staff to cater for demand 🤔 maybe… phone just rings out. What decade are we in? cmon seriously it’s pretty basic stuff. #COVID19Vic

Well, I have made an appointment to get my first dose of the #COVID19Vaccine in early May! I just hope it improves my phone coverage...
My internet access dropped right before my session was about to start...so I created a hotspot from my phone.  🙈 And my Zoom started to give funny errors right before another session..agreed that #zoomstress is real! 🤪
This afternoon's plan is to go to the Salvo's appointment to tell them I'm meant to be in the des stream so not with them and then have to.sorrt out getting a capacity assessment.\n\nI mean I could make the phone calls this morning, but phones are scary I'd rather just walk up
I was once told by a critical care doctor, when I’d recorded 320 phone calls over a weekend, that “we don’t care about waking you up; you’re on call, it’s your job”.\n\nSleep inertia is a barrier to good decision making. Courtesy is key, and patient safety must prevail.
Love to Google the phone number for my doctor every time instead of storing it my phone like a normal person
When I had GBS 2 years ago podcasts were the thing that got me through the downtime between doctor, physio &amp; friend visits. Still remember getting my mum to push "play" on my phone because my hands weren't even strong enough to grip and control the phone properly
My age group started last week but the doctor’s office doesn’t have any vaccine yet. They just say to phone back in a week or two.
So irritating Mary, no one can fit me in until after Easter AND on a phone consult with my Doctor he told me I probably have a common cold! “There’s nothing common about this cold, I can assure you!” I replied 😂
I phoned the National Covid phone number to clarify whether it’s an opt in system that requires people to make their own appointment or wait to be contacted. They confirmed that people have to make their own appt. For assistance, the website lists the National Relay Service.
I phoned the doctor’s office today. They said phone back in 2 weeks. They don’t know when they will have any vaccine yet.  I am 73. Group 1b.
Been working with patients 1-1 over Zoom for a year. Only last week did a patient ask for their first session to be over the phone. I use a lot of multimedia in my zoom sessions to illustrate ideas… not possible over the phone. And I do it all at a standing desk.

You tweeted this from your phone.... \n\nWe are living longer which means cancer rates are increasing. \n\nHistory would suggest socio-economic factors are contributing to birth rate and fertility. Birthrate will increase with increased socialised medicine and childcare.
No appointment at one more, another says it's a mess and we have to book online. Government websites says phone applicable nearby clinics. Another mess by this government   #VaccineRolloutSA
I was speaking to a lovely older man on the phone today and he was reading out his neighbour’s email address to me (I had to send out a letter for an appointment on Monday and he doesn’t have a computer). He got through the first part alright and then he paused and goes
Are you seriously suggesting that two adults, both millionaires in their own right, could not pick up a phone and arrange a visit to a mental health professional, especially as apparently Harry had been seeing one for years.
Yes I understand this 😰 I used to go and sit in the park when I had phone counselling through my work. I did it in my lunch break
Can they not run a face to face session by Zoom? Maybe no because kind of same as phone call but could you be in your room for it?
My doctor accepted a 3:30pm phone consult and said to get tested last time. Drive thru said nope to under 5. Local walk-in clinic closed around 4pm already. cbf waiting 3+ hours at a hospital to get a test. Got tested at the local clinic 830am next day. Negative day after.

Today I’ve had a phone meeting with my accountant, prepared some new marketing material for insta/OnlyFans and now I’m training... someone call a doctor I think I’m sick
This phone is chewing through the power more and more each day. It’s not that i shouldn’t be using my dilated eyes but that I am now on low-power mode (and waiting for doctor who is usually quite long, and probs moreso without an appointment)

Virtual CNY eve reunion dinner is basically transferring all those awkward silences onto the phone screen.\nThink I only spoke 3 times &amp; the entire video chat session only lasted 15 mins tops.\nWas slightly ambushed as I didn’t expect the call but it was good to see them all again.
AMS Redfern? They'll urge you to phone consult anyway.
Yes I agree, I joined and all I get these days us emails asking me to donate. No consultation,  invitation to branch meetings. I did get a phone call from a desperate state local member trying to get me to join her branch rather than the closest branch.
My favourite kind of monitoring visit - by phone and over in under a minute. 🥳
Yesterday, I didn’t leave my bed. I had an appointment with the GP over the phone, from my bed. Then I slept. And slept. And slept.
The GP registrar it took 7 days to get an "emergency" appointment with made 2 phone calls and got me correct treatment within an hour 🥰\nI'm in love!\nShame the ED visit, and a call then 8hr round trip to my oral surgeon didn't help this 15 days of agony🙄\n🤞For sleep🤞
Wonder if I'll have to call bc they forgot to ring or they'll call me. 6mins until phone appointment

My local Telstra shop can't be reached by phone. It either doesn't work or is always engaged. So it's necessary to go to \nthe shop to make an appointment. Waiting times are hours long. They are nice, but I've been 5 or 6 times and still have the same problem. What's the problem?
Our village Dafni is filled with all my great aunts &amp; uncles. I try to visit every summer b/c I need to see them all. Today my phone showed me this meal from Dafni, eaten with my great uncle Pavlo’s wine (I spend all year dreaming about the wine). I miss this so very painfully.
Hey  if I selected option 3, some eager customer will not know their appointment was cancelled bc the phone number/details were wrong. How is your customer going to know you had it wrong and what the correct details are? I feel bad for this person in Blackburn VIC!
I've had 4 shoulder ops in 40 years, 2 in my 20's, a knee replacement at age 60 in June. The doctor who spent the most amount of time with me, explained everything while awake and then checking on me post op in ward, &amp; by phone wad the anaesthetist. Last one went above and beyond

After hrs &amp; hrs with Telstra toing and froing on-line (phone calls are verboten), it has come to this. There is a 92yo man in the house &amp; if his wife goes out with the sketchy mobile he cannot phone an ambulance. Doctor has to get involved now because they can’t offer a service.

I saved this bathroom on my phone years ago.. i will visit this place soon #manifesting
People feel invisible when they feel forgotten. \n\nEvery culture is at its' core, SOCIAL. But social is not a phone or a platform. It's an activity that requires you to call, visit, pick up (groceries) for people who can't pick them up themselves. \n\nTo be social is to be HUMAN.

How are the doctors late for a phone consult ?!
I don’t understand the point of having a doctors appointment over the phone, if I have to still go and pick up my medical certificate?
Yes, it’s not an easy feeling mingling in hospitals when there’s lurgy about. I’m always glad for a Telehealth consultation. I haven’t seen the GP in many months. Had about a dozen phone calls I reckon. Hope they keep it going. Have a good chat tomoz.\nDon’t forget to listen. 😂😂
Too early for a busy day!\nSecond half of centre for psychotherapy assessment, a phone interview with  for a capacity assessment and back to town this Arvo for my 7suap therapy session. ☔🌦️
OMG, wtf is it with drs acting like a phone appt isn't an actual appt and can just be put off as long as they bloody well please?? 😤\n\nThe longest I've waited was an hour and 45min!! I couldn't even go to the loo, cuz they kept telling me (I kept calling) "you're next" 😡
So my doctors is now by phone appointment first, something I didn’t know about at the start of the week when I was ill. Tried to do a walk in today but had to make phone appointment, I now have a phone appointment tomorrow between 9-10am. More #COVIDVIC19 hassle
It’s ok, don’t blame Doc, she doesn’t work on Sat. \nOnly did tests 2.30pm Fri, Nurse called me when they got results 1pm Sat, to request to make appointment with Doc, they’re not allowed to tell you negative results over phone. \nBeen here before, I’ll be ok 👍💜
I don’t like interacting with telemarketers or “jumping on a quick call” when someone is trying to make a sales pitch. I’m able to talk fine on the phone to friends and family. I can manage making an appointment over the phone but often resist for a long time. 😆

An anonymous job service provider sends a message to my wife saying she missed a phone appointment.?? And payments are now on hold?? Her phone was not switched on, and no prior warning of an upcoming appointment. Wait until this is repeated by many thousands. And many are cut off
I get phone calls to my practice to complain about the attitudes of “that woman” (me) and when the complainer asks to be put through to the person in charge they get put through to me (medical director) and they say “oh sorry, I didn’t realise you were a doctor” surprise!
It took 4 years for my wife to finally having enough of me not scheduling a diagnosis appointment to say fuck it, picking up the phone and making an appointment right there and then.

RUOK is some corporate bullshit. If I said “no I’m not” they’d refer me to a phone number for 5 counselling sessions with some guy over the phone, whilst still maintaining every expectation for me. It’s a box ticking exercise, get lost with that shit
I just want a needle in my neck to give me some pain relief. Had a neuro phone consult. Waste of time and money. Now referred to another one. They better come up with a way to get rid of the pain or I'll probably just keep popping pills. Wheres that weed oil at?

Mansplaining doctor, on a topic nothing to with his field ...🙄 \n\nNearly had to throw out my phone, the patronising,  know-it-all crap was oozing though it \n💜😂😋
But ... this it the emergency appointment.  My normal appointment was 3 weeks ago. I only spoke with cardiologist. An administrative matter (a referral) is normally managed at reception. Now my GP has to do an emergency phone consult with me, so I can have an emergency cardiac
‘Getting referrals is patient’s responsibility’. \nI have now been refused my phone appointment because the Cardiologist’s PA didn’t tell me on Monday or Tuesday despite 3 phone calls and 2 emails that I required one. I would have had 36 hrs to see my GP and get a referral.

When I’m dreaming (like, asleep dreaming) the phone in the dream is always one of two old Nokia’s I had at 14 and 20. It’s nice my brain brings them to visit me, I guess? lol
Equally the emergency physician on-call after a fatiguing evening shift just dropped off to sleep when the phone rings 😂
The first lecture I was giving this semester we had a power blackout at out house. Backup plan zoom session off a hotspot on the phone for as long as the battery lasts on the laptop. Very surreal! Very 2020

Fabulous telehealth consult with my GP today. She was just as warm, thorough and helpful on the phone as in person. We discussed when I need in person consults and when telehealth is just fine. Person centred primary care.
Off to enjoy a phone chat with a client who's booked in a week's worth of sessions after lockdown, connecting before actual booking for me creates a more intense session 💗... Sorry only he gets to see underneath 💋
Should have gone 2 your local council used take 2 mins for paper work 5/10 min wait for all the people in front to get jab. Was quicker then getting into the footy! Just part of the GPs visit now days one phone call to let them know I would like one at regular app. Always free
Ok but like which phone case... I have to be able to have it on my phone while at work so it has to be appropriate so sadly I can’t get the medicine one I saw
Mum told me on the phone today that Doctor Bloomfield has become a cult sex symbol in NZ. I don't know if it's true, or if it's just my mum that fancies him. Any ladies in NZ care to confirm/deny?

I offer a phone chat session where it's $30 for half hour. Gives plenty time to hear my voice and hear that I am as authentic in real as I am online and thru my business\n\nI won't do free phone calls as mostly I've found they are not legitimate in their word in booking.
Due to Victoria's stage 4 lockdown/curfew, our personal trainer, Jared Adams can't come to us, or we to him. So we came up with a technological solution involving What's App, a phone and a tripod. We felt proper buggered after the session, so it seems to have worked correctly.
In case you haven’t worked it out yet, the covidsafe app is a FAILURE. That’s why every shop or dining establishment you visit gets you to sign in or scan a QR code, to track you still. Use fake names or phone numbers and don’t let them track you. Pretty simple!

I’ll never forget that time when I was at  Doctor Who Symphonic Spectacular and the orchestra was playing Tennant’s regeneration music and the girl next to my sister, bawling, pulled out her phone and wept to her lock screen wallpaper of the Tenth Doctor.
So i had an appointment at Medical Audiology Services this morning to discuss hearing. Did a few tests and results similar as specialist 2 months ago so now trialling a pair for 2 weeks. Have an app on phone to control sounds.

Ward clerk came down, had no information on Pa’s condition. I asked to speak to a doctor or a nurse, told no but I can call the ward. Tried &amp; tried, no answer. Told to leave hospital and keep trying phone. Clerk said she would give overnight bag I packed to my Pa.

Man it felt good... got an earlier appointment but fucking pissed off as I asked if they could take photo or film a few seconds.   Came out of chamber and she says “oh shit I forgot to take photo, yet she had my phone in her hands when I went into chamber
Oh and had a 10am appt this morning which I couldn’t cancel bc the phone number for the store was not connected and no one in Telstra online or with the app could help

Just had one of the saddest moments during this whole Pandemic. my 86 year old uncles health is failing fast. We spoke on the phone, and all I can do is to say I love you and I miss you and that I’m heart broken that I cannot come visit you in respite care. #lockdownMelbourne 😭
I found these photos on my phone tonight. Jack’s visit to Australia. #sydney
i remember literally every session was maybe 40 mins and she’d be on the phone for about 25 of it and then be like so if it’s not a relationship or a friendship that you’re sad about... what is it? like bruh that’s y i am here
I reli don’t know how  get 3.9 rates🤔🤔 I made an appointment at 5:45 pm today and wait for almost 30mins without anyone coming. P.S. there is no receptionist at door 😫😫 Reli disappointed and I couldn’t vote on google thru my phone. Strongly not recommended 👎👎
you’ve done it again. #Floptus I’ve tried to assist setting up my mums home phone for a month now. You cancelled her nbn setup visit and still haven’t contacted her after a week and now send her another nbn box. You guys are the worst for customer service.
To get told your results over the phone costs $40 from a doctor. Y’all are thieves. Good thing you can claim shit back from Medicare.

I’ve been a principal of one teacher rural schools for 27 years Lenore. In that time I haven’t received a visit, letter, email, phone call , message from a Nationals ( State or fed) candidate or member to ask how we were going or how they can help or even introduce themselves.
Patients over the phone: *tells me their entire sexual history for 15 mins*\n\nMe: "Err...how can I help?"\n\nP: "Can I see a doctor?"\n\nMe: "Yes... yes, let's start with that."
In 27 years as a principal of small rural schools I haven’t had even a generic letter from them, let alone a visit, email, phone call etc asking about how we are going, what can they do for us, what are our challenges etc. they don’t represent rural state schools that’s for sure!

Hi. My Mum and sister have both been tested. Referred by GP. Done at pathology clinic. Results delivered by doctor via phone call within 48 hrs. Both negative. 😀
Can you get a Telehealth appointment by Monday? They might order bloods over the phone, and you’ll have the results by your appointment on Monday.
I remember in college 2010, i was going 2 visit a guy, was on a motobike, and he called me 2 know if i was close, on recieving the call, my phone disappeared n my hands were still in my ears acting as if i was still on call. The thing shock me. Till today not sure how it happened
GPs are adapting to this. Which is why using good online platforms is so much better than just a telephone consultation
I’ve had SOS cell phone reception in all but a two-meter radius from the front window for most of today. I’m relying on a single bar of 3G reception. Telehealth appointment could not be done via video. Even as audio only, I lost connection several times and had to be called back.

My sister is 64 on JobSeeker. Last week #SarinoRusso started pressuring her 2 return 2 volunteering. She's been bac 4 three weeks as soon as it was legal to do so. They send a text &amp; say "you've a phone appointment in 3 hours. Be at your computer or be cut off" They r vultures

No jobseeker payment here. Approved for it but has never eventuated. Mygov a/c gives a date &amp; amount which always changes to the next day. Going to visit centrelink today as there’s no assistance via phone. Wish me luck 😷
You may understand my own amazement when I say the best thing to happen to me today was a phone call today from my hair dresser offering me an appointment. Never thought I’d be so happy. Good to hear  #minkhairandbody on Royal Parade are preparing to re-open
I've only been able to visit once, for an hour. Not much time to chat with staff. Convos with RNs were by phone.
No need for nerves in the end, the clinic I was meant to get the jab at told me and another bloke to turn up at 4 when they close at 3\n\nThe kicker is a car was in the doctor’s carpark but nobody was answering the door or phone
Just wanted 2say a BIG thank you 4the phone call from the lovely Brie. I’m still house hunting &amp;she totally understood that coming in for an appointment then undoing it all by all of this running around would be a waste. I’ll be in touch soon👌🏻
Looking to change obstetricians. Really getting too overwhelming. Respect goes both ways. Being on phone calls in our appointment and wanting to get wife out the door. It’s just not acceptable. Making to feel like a burden on them. Ridiculous
Had one of those socially distancing vet appointments today - we stay outside whilst consultation goes on inside with dog, and over the phone. Wonder if vets will ever want pet owners in their clinics again after #Covid_19australia Dog came out v happy, assume bcoz of many treats

Just falling in love with the hot doctor over the phone during iso
Agree. For example many GPs doing phone only consults at the moment. Miss so much when can’t see patient. e.g patient with mild Bells Palsy. Avoidable ED visit. Unnecessary risk and cost to system and patient (time, travel) So barriers need to be explored and solved.
Having a phone consult with my GP shortly and I'm sad about missing the bit when she turns and looks into my soul and asks me how I am like she really wants to know.
From today, April 27 2020, Dentists in Australia are permitted to treat patients on level 2 restrictions. Phone our lovely front desk on 02 4961 6300 to make your appointment 💫🦷👄
I don’t think so, and if you don’t take your phone with you when you go out then there’s not much value in the app anyway (other than when people visit you)
✅ Our phones store much more personal details now - Who we call, where we go, what sites we visit. And why? zero health or other benefit to the owner of the phone. This app is less intrusive and aimed purely at our health. Simple choice: decline the app means choose to stay home

Had my first appointment with my new GP on the phone and it was quite good. He was attentive and interested in my condition and already referred me to a specialist. A professor even.
AIPA Chair and Strategy Group member, Tania Dalton (Jones) highlights phone/online counselling is available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and mental health practitioners need to practice to a culturally safe standard to ensure therapeutic support is delivered.
You're right, though I would struggle with a phone appointment because somehow phone calls make me more anxious than face to face conversations.
I haven't been tested because there's no need to. If I feel ill then I definitely will. I can have an visual appointment with my Dr on my phone. All good

Phone or Skype consult. Previously not billable to medicare but now can. Great where no physical intervention is required which is common in a GP consult.
Call your GP or specialist to book an appointment as normal. It will then be scheduled take place by phone or video depending on your resources and if it can actually be done remotely (e.g. not a blood test or something)
Absolutely. If brief phone counselling simply refers to state-based services already at capacity, it will not help. More funding to assist in employing caseworkers on the ground in communities who can navigate housing, legal and medical solutions is necessary #dfv #COVID19Aus
It will not cost Govt a cent more for HMR to go to telephone consult. I am not asking for this format forever. We have VERY vulnerable patients needing a voice of reason in their lives right now
Sounds good in theory. I feel very sceptical any Doctor could correctly diagnose my health through me talking alone on a mobile phone m.
With the greatest of respect, more ‘phone counselling’ for #dfv won’t cut it. If all they can do is a brief counselling session and then refer on to other frontline services that are already at capacity, women &amp; kids will be stuck in an endless loop. #dfv
My mum’s GP just called. She had a phone consult booked but didn’t answer. Her mobile is off and her home phone gives a ring that sounds suspiciously like she’s left it off the hook/knocked it/forgotten to hang up. Not answering SMS.

Yes. Not all flu is COVID19. Stay at home - self isolate. Only contact helpline / GP / physician over the phone. If symptoms worsen after 3-5 days then contact doc to arrange for testing.
I finished my jobseeker claim up until the part where I have to book a phone appointment but the website was not allowing me to. What can you help me with there?
I did and they told me I can do a phone consultation.  The Doctor will phone me around my appointment time. That makes me feel better.
Some appreciated feedback. Mind you this session was by phone 📲 . Pls know we are still in operation and taking all measures to ensure a sanitized working environment. Skypes / Zooms / phone sessions continue to be in operation 🙏🏻\n#healers #melbournehealers #wedothework

If unsure phone your doctor 1st.\nGet yourself tested if they do that easily in Scotland. \nIf that 12 days is physical isolation another 2 days isolation won't hurt.\nLook, just talkl to your doctor and remember hand and cough hygiene. \n\nGood luck.

Sorry to those requesting bookings. \n\nI'm not available for real time bookings til Monday. Book ahead👌 can do phone bookings tho beemit is payment method\n\nIn meantime, ask who I recommend with what session. Always happy to refer you to someone I know personally and have met.
The centre can also offer support information, as well as telephone support, available 6-9pm, on Thursday and Saturdays. \n\nAll services are provided free, and can be accessed anonymously if requested. Visit their website for more information -
Being socially responsible won't feed your kid.\nI think the Government needs to seriously look at that. At least have some amnesty where you can phone doctor and your GP with questioning can then issue something to employer AND that has to be on medicare, no gap.
I have a surprise for you guys who prefer Thursday love\n\nI'm coming in to visit  this Thursday between 11am - 8pm\n\nPrebookings make me juicier. \n\nPhone number and my website is in my bio 😜
25/01/2019( if your a GROW full program client relax, your safe!)\n\nArmyworm in full fledge today, greater Sydney, new client, first visit from GROW and all sorted👍\n\nOur phone is ringing off the hook for these pests…
your Cairns Officeworks never pick the phone it’s a 3rd day in a row, I can’t visit them. Is there any way to speak your customer service regarding invoice.
Fabulous news. Does your doctor not pick up the phone these days?
Yep, this has been our typical experience as well. Worst still are University counselling centres that insist on calling you when booking appointments. Like phone phobia is one of the reasons for needing an appointment in the first place!
I have an ap on my phone called qoctor which is a service set up by doctors in Aus who will do a consultation via video Skype and provide a med cert. they are strict &amp; refund fee if they do not believe you or they believe it's imperative you get to a medical centre instead.
Just had probably the loveliest phone chat with a new client. Wanting to book a specific session with me. \nAnd I also love he wants to pop his virginity with a mature woman who knows how to love a man. His words. He's done his homework brownie points. \nMy yoni wetter if possible
Uh oh... caught looking at my phone again! But was a great session thanks  and team
IME there's no ongoing advice nor support.\nI learnt online as best I could, by reading neuroscience &amp; those PLWD who write. No public services, no health care planning, no enablement. Maybe phone counselling, if you're lucky- in office hours only. At the mercy of providers.
BAHAHAHHAHAAHA!! And when you pick up the phone to make a call you can hear the transmission noise during active session on the net 😂😂 and especially when you’re on msn you know the connection goes off when the little green emoji spins! Dinosaur days 😂
My doctor said if you want it to work take it at least an hour before bed but make sure you body is winding down so it can take it's affect. Like I shower and lay in the dark straight after with my phone brightness all the way down. Then no technology so my brain knows it's bed.
The referring doctor was told it was an inappropriate ED referral which was met with ‘well, they’re on their way’ and the phone being hung up 3/5
12 employees standing around doing nothing and only two customers in the store, yet could only ask about one thing per appointment WTF SO PISSED OFF! Told to make another appointment to discuss my phone.
rang yesterday about a SIM tray, told to go in today. Went, told they need to be ordered! Could have told me that when l rang yesterday! Wanted to ask about a problem with a phone and he said that another appointment would have to be made for that🤬
Experts tell u to put the phone down before bed if you can’t sleep but I’m productively omw to snooze fest just scrolling thru endless twitter bs as my eyelids are heavier than my first ever counselling session in 2016
Got an idea how to provide reliable telephone services when the old copper lines have been abandoned in favour of NBN services?\n\n
You don’t need a CT scan for a fever. I suggest you get on the phone to your doctor back in Belgium.
Incredible that I can take out a home loan from my phone but can’t make an appointment without something being faxed! 😳
Trying to organise a scan at the hospital and the woman on the other end of the phone told me she couldn’t help me unless I “faxed the request” - I couldn’t help replying w “well it’s not 1988 so I don’t have a fax” She wasn’t impressed 😬 meanwhile I still don’t have an appt.
In independent fee for service practice the idea is for the first contact, be it by phone, email, or sms, to result in a kept first appointment.
And then she said my mum wasn’t answering her phone (she was at a hospital appointment with my stepdad) and I said I couldn’t give her my dads number bc he was out of the country for work and she threatens to suspend me 🤪
Phone early when making your appointment.  They need time to organise the men in the white coats
To be honest there is enough pressure on NICU mums and adding this to it seems stupid. I understand the principle I suppose but it’s all about balance. We have parents who don’t visit their kids and so a cuddle with them staring at a phone is better than not.
Another goal for me too. I’m lazy and love the convenience of my phone 😉
That's it. We've had 1 phone call &amp; 1 visit over the past 3 weeks. I don't believe in promises &amp; I will no longer spend energy on those who mouth platitudes. This is my NY resolution - ignore those who ignore us. That goes for so-called "advocacy" organizations too.

I need to cancel an appointment for today as I am unwell, but I cannot reach you. Is there an email address or alternate phone number I can use?
So every time I visit my Uncle Guenter (80yo), there's a list of tasks that need doing. One of them is always deleting people from his mobile phone who've died :/
Been looking after mum with no break since dad died almost 2 y ago . She has dementia, breast cancer, ( more imaging this week) and arthritic knees so she’s wobbly on her feet. She has 3 daughters, 5 granddaughters, they don’t phone they don’t visit. Patriarchy?
I got there only to realise she had cancelled. She tried to call me but my phone must be playing up because I didn’t get any calls. So I went all the way there for an appointment I didn’t even have. Oh and I won’t be able to get in for ages.

Hold on... Wait a minute... Hold the phone... it gets worse because apparently that’s possible. This session was even more inaccessible than the last one. One of the exercises involved looking at pictures. I kid you not. Fucking. Pictures.

No, just lost mine :-( they were paired against different people. You can't delete a phone without a keycard and can't delete a keycard without the list key card. Major security fail. I'm waiting a week for a callback for a USB cable. I bet this ends in SC visit.

I can remember the pre-internet BBS era before ISP's (1980's). You didn't visit a website by google searching, you dialled up each one individually from their phone numbers printed in a magazine! There was only one here in Albury too lol. I'm so old...
Must you continually ejaculate such excrement! Put your phone down Don, or use it to call a good doctor...
Love to just...not be called by the phone counselling service as scheduled 🙃 luckily I have a psychologist appointment tomorrow! Things are a bit rough right now. Leaving “mid-semester” break until 10 weeks in is not cool, ACU! I need a rest!
Actually I agree!  Get most annoyed when prompt adhoc service is demanded 4 routine care usually needing appt &amp; they think its our job to call GP etc  for info (nope. "Here's a phone, tell practice nurse to fax to xxxx xxxx") or arrange authority scripts
WOW... assuming the official watchdog will be issued with a tin foil hat as part of uniform on appointment, and a telephone hotline to the IPA to “validate” what the required politically scientific validated answer is.

I get sad every time I add my weight and body fat into my phone and it keeps reminding me of how little progress I've made and how far away from my goal I am. Apparently I'm also obese according to BMI. My doctor told me that I'm not obese and BMI is useless. Who to believe!?
So the M’sian doctor at the ED saw mine &amp; Joyce’s (next of kin) phone number then said:\nWah your parents allow you 2 to have so many 4s in your phone number?\n\nI replied: this is Australia, Chinese superstition don’t work here!\n\nHe responded: that’s exactly what I told my parents.
My doctor is excellent, but to prescribe Panadeine Forte he has to get permission by phone from bureaucrats in Canberra, which is offensive. OTC Mersyndol worked better with far less codeine content but now of course you can't get it(on the PBS), forcing people into heavier stuff

Why didn't they just X-ray on the spot? When I finally went to a family doctor he ordered an immediate x-ray and ten minutes later he did a telephone referral to a surgeon while we admired the picture of my mangled bone.

I can’t get my head around how this is legal, when there is supposed to be confidentiality within the doctor/nurse, patient relationship. I’m not even allowed to share information about my patients over the phone, unless I know for sure I’m speaking to a parent or legal guardian.
