40 yrs of Big Consult getting it wrong\n\n‚ÄúIn mid 1980s, AT&amp;T hired McKinsey to forecast cell phone adoption in the US by 2020. After racking up a multi million dollar bill, McKinsey said the answer would be 900,000 subscribers.\nThey were off by a factor of 120x.‚Äù Tony Seba
It was definately a wink. If it were a twitch she should phone her doctor.

You can try contacting the Department of Health. They have a phone line for queries about seniors. Offer to get a medical certificate from her doctor.\nOtherwise the plan was to open regional from Nov 1 if vaccine numbers are high enough. But that's still 22 days away.\nGood luck.

I provided a printout from my doctor for evidence of the flu shot that also showed my first COVID-19 vaccination. I expect similar would suffice although I‚Äôm anticipating phone wallets to hold evidence of vaccinations at some point soon. That would certainly suit a wider usage.
After waiting 20 minutes for my appointment  now coming up to another 20 minutes of the guy trying to get through to the bank on the phone. We are trying not to üëÄ each other, listening to the phone ring. Awkward.
So my surgical follow-up on Friday got changed to a phone appointment, which was pushed until 5:30 today. Turns out my pinky should have more movement than it does by now (basically none).\n\nUrgent x-rays tomorrow morning üò¨

Agree. For example many GPs doing phone only consults at the moment. Miss so much when can‚Äôt see patient. e.g patient with mild Bells Palsy. Avoidable ED visit. Unnecessary risk and cost to system and patient (time, travel) So barriers need to be explored and solved.

AIPA Chair and Strategy Group member, Tania Dalton (Jones) highlights phone/online counselling is available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and mental health practitioners need to practice to a culturally safe standard to ensure therapeutic support is delivered.
You're right, though I would struggle with a phone appointment because somehow phone calls make me more anxious than face to face conversations.
I haven't been tested because there's no need to. If I feel ill then I definitely will. I can have an visual appointment with my Dr on my phone. All good

Absolutely. If brief phone counselling simply refers to state-based services already at capacity, it will not help. More funding to assist in employing caseworkers on the ground in communities who can navigate housing, legal and medical solutions is necessary #dfv #COVID19Aus
It will not cost Govt a cent more for HMR to go to telephone consult. I am not asking for this format forever. We have VERY vulnerable patients needing a voice of reason in their lives right now

So I have a cold, after being away, got cold and flu tabs but mrs said ring the doc to check anyway\nSo rang them and they are now going to do an over phone consult.\nWTF??!!\nHow can you diagnose the diff between common cold and #CoronaVirus over the phone.
My mum was married w three kids at my age and I can‚Äôt even book my own doctors appt over the phone HA. #anxiouslife
Sorry to those requesting bookings. \n\nI'm not available for real time bookings til Monday. Book aheadüëå can do phone bookings tho beemit is payment method\n\nIn meantime, ask who I recommend with what session. Always happy to refer you to someone I know personally and have met.
The centre can also offer support information, as well as telephone support, available 6-9pm, on Thursday and Saturdays. \n\nAll services are provided free, and can be accessed anonymously if requested. Visit their website for more information -
Being socially responsible won't feed your kid.\nI think the Government needs to seriously look at that. At least have some amnesty where you can phone doctor and your GP with questioning can then issue something to employer AND that has to be on medicare, no gap.
I have a surprise for you guys who prefer Thursday love\n\nI'm coming in to visit  this Thursday between 11am - 8pm\n\nPrebookings make me juicier. \n\nPhone number and my website is in my bio üòú

your Cairns Officeworks never pick the phone it‚Äôs a 3rd day in a row, I can‚Äôt visit them. Is there any way to speak your customer service regarding invoice.
Fabulous news. Does your doctor not pick up the phone these days?
Yep, this has been our typical experience as well. Worst still are University counselling centres that insist on calling you when booking appointments. Like phone phobia is one of the reasons for needing an appointment in the first place!
I have an ap on my phone called qoctor which is a service set up by doctors in Aus who will do a consultation via video Skype and provide a med cert. they are strict &amp; refund fee if they do not believe you or they believe it's imperative you get to a medical centre instead.
Just had probably the loveliest phone chat with a new client. Wanting to book a specific session with me. \nAnd I also love he wants to pop his virginity with a mature woman who knows how to love a man. His words. He's done his homework brownie points. \nMy yoni wetter if possible
Uh oh... caught looking at my phone again! But was a great session thanks  and team
IME there's no ongoing advice nor support.\nI learnt online as best I could, by reading neuroscience &amp; those PLWD who write. No public services, no health care planning, no enablement. Maybe phone counselling, if you're lucky- in office hours only. At the mercy of providers.
BAHAHAHHAHAAHA!! And when you pick up the phone to make a call you can hear the transmission noise during active session on the net üòÇüòÇ and especially when you‚Äôre on msn you know the connection goes off when the little green emoji spins! Dinosaur days üòÇ
My doctor said if you want it to work take it at least an hour before bed but make sure you body is winding down so it can take it's affect. Like I shower and lay in the dark straight after with my phone brightness all the way down. Then no technology so my brain knows it's bed.
The referring doctor was told it was an inappropriate ED referral which was met with ‚Äòwell, they‚Äôre on their way‚Äô and the phone being hung up 3/5
12 employees standing around doing nothing and only two customers in the store, yet could only ask about one thing per appointment WTF SO PISSED OFF! Told to make another appointment to discuss my phone.
rang yesterday about a SIM tray, told to go in today. Went, told they need to be ordered! Could have told me that when l rang yesterday! Wanted to ask about a problem with a phone and he said that another appointment would have to be made for thatü§¨
Experts tell u to put the phone down before bed if you can‚Äôt sleep but I‚Äôm productively omw to snooze fest just scrolling thru endless twitter bs as my eyelids are heavier than my first ever counselling session in 2016
Got an idea how to provide reliable telephone services when the old copper lines have been abandoned in favour of NBN services?\n\n
You don‚Äôt need a CT scan for a fever. I suggest you get on the phone to your doctor back in Belgium.
Incredible that I can take out a home loan from my phone but can‚Äôt make an appointment without something being faxed! üò≥
Trying to organise a scan at the hospital and the woman on the other end of the phone told me she couldn‚Äôt help me unless I ‚Äúfaxed the request‚Äù - I couldn‚Äôt help replying w ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not 1988 so I don‚Äôt have a fax‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt impressed üò¨ meanwhile I still don‚Äôt have an appt.
In independent fee for service practice the idea is for the first contact, be it by phone, email, or sms, to result in a kept first appointment.
And then she said my mum wasn‚Äôt answering her phone (she was at a hospital appointment with my stepdad) and I said I couldn‚Äôt give her my dads number bc he was out of the country for work and she threatens to suspend me ü§™
Phone early when making your appointment.  They need time to organise the men in the white coats
To be honest there is enough pressure on NICU mums and adding this to it seems stupid. I understand the principle I suppose but it‚Äôs all about balance. We have parents who don‚Äôt visit their kids and so a cuddle with them staring at a phone is better than not.
Another goal for me too. I‚Äôm lazy and love the convenience of my phone üòâ
That's it. We've had 1 phone call &amp; 1 visit over the past 3 weeks. I don't believe in promises &amp; I will no longer spend energy on those who mouth platitudes. This is my NY resolution - ignore those who ignore us. That goes for so-called "advocacy" organizations too.

I got there only to realise she had cancelled. She tried to call me but my phone must be playing up because I didn‚Äôt get any calls. So I went all the way there for an appointment I didn‚Äôt even have. Oh and I won‚Äôt be able to get in for ages.

I get sad every time I add my weight and body fat into my phone and it keeps reminding me of how little progress I've made and how far away from my goal I am. Apparently I'm also obese according to BMI. My doctor told me that I'm not obese and BMI is useless. Who to believe!?
So the M‚Äôsian doctor at the ED saw mine &amp; Joyce‚Äôs (next of kin) phone number then said:\nWah your parents allow you 2 to have so many 4s in your phone number?\n\nI replied: this is Australia, Chinese superstition don‚Äôt work here!\n\nHe responded: that‚Äôs exactly what I told my parents.
My doctor is excellent, but to prescribe Panadeine Forte he has to get permission by phone from bureaucrats in Canberra, which is offensive. OTC Mersyndol worked better with far less codeine content but now of course you can't get it(on the PBS), forcing people into heavier stuff

People feel invisible when they feel forgotten. \n\nEvery culture is at its' core, SOCIAL. But social is not a phone or a platform. It's an activity that requires you to call, visit, pick up (groceries) for people who can't pick them up themselves. \n\nTo be social is to be HUMAN.

How are the doctors late for a phone consult ?!
I don‚Äôt understand the point of having a doctors appointment over the phone, if I have to still go and pick up my medical certificate?
Yes, it‚Äôs not an easy feeling mingling in hospitals when there‚Äôs lurgy about. I‚Äôm always glad for a Telehealth consultation. I haven‚Äôt seen the GP in many months. Had about a dozen phone calls I reckon. Hope they keep it going. Have a good chat tomoz.\nDon‚Äôt forget to listen. üòÇüòÇ

My GP does most of consult by phone with patient outside in car. Only go in at last minute for physical part. Otherwise telehealth. NO patients in waiting room. GP wears scrubs &amp; mask. Minimal risk. Rheumy, endo, gastro specialists all doing telehealth where possible.

But ... this it the emergency appointment.  My normal appointment was 3 weeks ago. I only spoke with cardiologist. An administrative matter (a referral) is normally managed at reception. Now my GP has to do an emergency phone consult with me, so I can have an emergency cardiac
‚ÄòGetting referrals is patient‚Äôs responsibility‚Äô. \nI have now been refused my phone appointment because the Cardiologist‚Äôs PA didn‚Äôt tell me on Monday or Tuesday despite 3 phone calls and 2 emails that I required one. I would have had 36 hrs to see my GP and get a referral.
What website do you visit the most? ‚Äî Twitter and instagram and maybe Facebook for 5 minutes but I try not be on my phone or laptop to much

Fabulous telehealth consult with my GP today. She was just as warm, thorough and helpful on the phone as in person. We discussed when I need in person consults and when telehealth is just fine. Person centred primary care.
Off to enjoy a phone chat with a client who's booked in a week's worth of sessions after lockdown, connecting before actual booking for me creates a more intense session üíó... Sorry only he gets to see underneath üíã
Should have gone 2 your local council used take 2 mins for paper work 5/10 min wait for all the people in front to get jab. Was quicker then getting into the footy! Just part of the GPs visit now days one phone call to let them know I would like one at regular app. Always free
Ok but like which phone case... I have to be able to have it on my phone while at work so it has to be appropriate so sadly I can‚Äôt get the medicine one I saw

Due to Victoria's stage 4 lockdown/curfew, our personal trainer, Jared Adams can't come to us, or we to him. So we came up with a technological solution involving What's App, a phone and a tripod. We felt proper buggered after the session, so it seems to have worked correctly.
In case you haven‚Äôt worked it out yet, the covidsafe app is a FAILURE. That‚Äôs why every shop or dining establishment you visit gets you to sign in or scan a QR code, to track you still. Use fake names or phone numbers and don‚Äôt let them track you. Pretty simple!

Agree. For example many GPs doing phone only consults at the moment. Miss so much when can‚Äôt see patient. e.g patient with mild Bells Palsy. Avoidable ED visit. Unnecessary risk and cost to system and patient (time, travel) So barriers need to be explored and solved.

AIPA Chair and Strategy Group member, Tania Dalton (Jones) highlights phone/online counselling is available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and mental health practitioners need to practice to a culturally safe standard to ensure therapeutic support is delivered.
You're right, though I would struggle with a phone appointment because somehow phone calls make me more anxious than face to face conversations.
I haven't been tested because there's no need to. If I feel ill then I definitely will. I can have an visual appointment with my Dr on my phone. All good
Thank you  for this article on  Financial counselling is free and still only a phone call away during #COVID__19. As our CEO says üëáthey'll help you to make ends meet if you've lost income or work, please don't turn to pay-day lenders
And it continues ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n.\nToday was my 5th visit to the GP in 8 weeks for the same fucking problem. I actually got to have an in person consult not a phone call or car park chat (I feel so privileged *not*).\n.\nI now‚Ä¶

This one is now curious how a phone interview about my back and leg problems is going to help me, instead of being able to go to the PA hospital about it and see the doctor in person about it\n\nFuck this virus.

Not yesterday‚Äôs announcement. Phone counselling only so far.

You‚Äôve heard of Lifeline? A 50yo t√©l√©phone counselling service. In 2003 Steve Jobs produced the FaceTime camera. Still have mine, and we have domestic video conferencing, suitable for professional counselling. In five years, we‚Äôll do it in #VR. Google:

Phone or Skype consult. Previously not billable to medicare but now can. Great where no physical intervention is required which is common in a GP consult.
Call your GP or specialist to book an appointment as normal. It will then be scheduled take place by phone or video depending on your resources and if it can actually be done remotely (e.g. not a blood test or something)
Absolutely. If brief phone counselling simply refers to state-based services already at capacity, it will not help. More funding to assist in employing caseworkers on the ground in communities who can navigate housing, legal and medical solutions is necessary #dfv #COVID19Aus
It will not cost Govt a cent more for HMR to go to telephone consult. I am not asking for this format forever. We have VERY vulnerable patients needing a voice of reason in their lives right now
Sounds good in theory. I feel very sceptical any Doctor could correctly diagnose my health through me talking alone on a mobile phone m.
With the greatest of respect, more ‚Äòphone counselling‚Äô for #dfv won‚Äôt cut it. If all they can do is a brief counselling session and then refer on to other frontline services that are already at capacity, women &amp; kids will be stuck in an endless loop. #dfv
My mum‚Äôs GP just called. She had a phone consult booked but didn‚Äôt answer. Her mobile is off and her home phone gives a ring that sounds suspiciously like she‚Äôs left it off the hook/knocked it/forgotten to hang up. Not answering SMS.

I was chatting to a guy on the phone today, he‚Äôs 68 and has essentially no immune system and he‚Äôs planning on going to the shops this week. I said stay home, his brother said stay home and his career said stay home, but he‚Äôs waiting to hear what the doctor reckons üôÑü§¨

Yes. Not all flu is COVID19. Stay at home - self isolate. Only contact helpline / GP / physician over the phone. If symptoms worsen after 3-5 days then contact doc to arrange for testing.
I finished my jobseeker claim up until the part where I have to book a phone appointment but the website was not allowing me to. What can you help me with there?
I did and they told me I can do a phone consultation.  The Doctor will phone me around my appointment time. That makes me feel better.
Some appreciated feedback. Mind you this session was by phone üì≤ . Pls know we are still in operation and taking all measures to ensure a sanitized working environment. Skypes / Zooms / phone sessions continue to be in operation üôèüèª\n#healers #melbournehealers #wedothework

Here‚Äôs a cool thing. Just scored a bulk-bilked appointment with my GP (we did it by phone) Turns out being immunocompromised means I meet the criteria. Nice to have one, albeit small, financial win in the face of all the work I had to cancel this week! #covid19australia #perth
If unsure phone your doctor 1st.\nGet yourself tested if they do that easily in Scotland. \nIf that 12 days is physical isolation another 2 days isolation won't hurt.\nLook, just talkl to your doctor and remember hand and cough hygiene. \n\nGood luck.
It's a long hairdressing appointment when you have to bring a packed lunch, phone charger, a form guide and $100 in your betting account.

Yep all very difficult. Have just changed my appt with respiratory specialist at Royal Hobart to a phone review to hopefully take some pressure off doctor, hospital resources - &amp; me.really we all need to be thoughtful &amp; careful. Stay safe everyone
No one should attend gp‚Äôs in person with cough/fever please call first and ask for telephone consult, think about the vulnerable people in the waiting room, the staff and medicos, if you spread to this group it‚Äôs catastrophic

My SuperFund cannot give direction over the phone. They can only assist with enquires. You have to make an appointment (weeks-months). Given #COVID19au need to offer this by email or direct call for professional direction.  step up to the plate please.
Plus...I can‚Äôt talk with you directly on the phone for an update. I have to call Telstra....wait 20min for them to speak with you and then relay the message to me. My question is this though....if a technician checked the area 2 days prior to the appointment and said it was ok..
If you are a doctor and a patient presents with this history phone 1300 445 715. These patients have a programmed screening and specialist care pathway.
You go to the dr with flu-like symptoms and instead of being seen face to face; instead you have a phone consultation with the dr. How is this an efficient way in diagnosing anyone? #flu #coldnotvirus #coronapocolypse #COVID19Aus

So I have a cold, after being away, got cold and flu tabs but mrs said ring the doc to check anyway\nSo rang them and they are now going to do an over phone consult.\nWTF??!!\nHow can you diagnose the diff between common cold and #CoronaVirus over the phone.
My mum was married w three kids at my age and I can‚Äôt even book my own doctors appt over the phone HA. #anxiouslife
Sorry to those requesting bookings. \n\nI'm not available for real time bookings til Monday. Book aheadüëå can do phone bookings tho beemit is payment method\n\nIn meantime, ask who I recommend with what session. Always happy to refer you to someone I know personally and have met.

Being socially responsible won't feed your kid.\nI think the Government needs to seriously look at that. At least have some amnesty where you can phone doctor and your GP with questioning can then issue something to employer AND that has to be on medicare, no gap.

your Cairns Officeworks never pick the phone it‚Äôs a 3rd day in a row, I can‚Äôt visit them. Is there any way to speak your customer service regarding invoice.
Fabulous news. Does your doctor not pick up the phone these days?
Yep, this has been our typical experience as well. Worst still are University counselling centres that insist on calling you when booking appointments. Like phone phobia is one of the reasons for needing an appointment in the first place!
I have an ap on my phone called qoctor which is a service set up by doctors in Aus who will do a consultation via video Skype and provide a med cert. they are strict &amp; refund fee if they do not believe you or they believe it's imperative you get to a medical centre instead.
Just had probably the loveliest phone chat with a new client. Wanting to book a specific session with me. \nAnd I also love he wants to pop his virginity with a mature woman who knows how to love a man. His words. He's done his homework brownie points. \nMy yoni wetter if possible
Uh oh... caught looking at my phone again! But was a great session thanks  and team
IME there's no ongoing advice nor support.\nI learnt online as best I could, by reading neuroscience &amp; those PLWD who write. No public services, no health care planning, no enablement. Maybe phone counselling, if you're lucky- in office hours only. At the mercy of providers.
BAHAHAHHAHAAHA!! And when you pick up the phone to make a call you can hear the transmission noise during active session on the net üòÇüòÇ and especially when you‚Äôre on msn you know the connection goes off when the little green emoji spins! Dinosaur days üòÇ
My doctor said if you want it to work take it at least an hour before bed but make sure you body is winding down so it can take it's affect. Like I shower and lay in the dark straight after with my phone brightness all the way down. Then no technology so my brain knows it's bed.
The referring doctor was told it was an inappropriate ED referral which was met with ‚Äòwell, they‚Äôre on their way‚Äô and the phone being hung up 3/5
12 employees standing around doing nothing and only two customers in the store, yet could only ask about one thing per appointment WTF SO PISSED OFF! Told to make another appointment to discuss my phone.
rang yesterday about a SIM tray, told to go in today. Went, told they need to be ordered! Could have told me that when l rang yesterday! Wanted to ask about a problem with a phone and he said that another appointment would have to be made for thatü§¨

Got an idea how to provide reliable telephone services when the old copper lines have been abandoned in favour of NBN services?\n\n
You don‚Äôt need a CT scan for a fever. I suggest you get on the phone to your doctor back in Belgium.
Incredible that I can take out a home loan from my phone but can‚Äôt make an appointment without something being faxed! üò≥
Trying to organise a scan at the hospital and the woman on the other end of the phone told me she couldn‚Äôt help me unless I ‚Äúfaxed the request‚Äù - I couldn‚Äôt help replying w ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not 1988 so I don‚Äôt have a fax‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt impressed üò¨ meanwhile I still don‚Äôt have an appt.
In independent fee for service practice the idea is for the first contact, be it by phone, email, or sms, to result in a kept first appointment.
And then she said my mum wasn‚Äôt answering her phone (she was at a hospital appointment with my stepdad) and I said I couldn‚Äôt give her my dads number bc he was out of the country for work and she threatens to suspend me ü§™
Phone early when making your appointment.  They need time to organise the men in the white coats
To be honest there is enough pressure on NICU mums and adding this to it seems stupid. I understand the principle I suppose but it‚Äôs all about balance. We have parents who don‚Äôt visit their kids and so a cuddle with them staring at a phone is better than not.
Another goal for me too. I‚Äôm lazy and love the convenience of my phone üòâ
That's it. We've had 1 phone call &amp; 1 visit over the past 3 weeks. I don't believe in promises &amp; I will no longer spend energy on those who mouth platitudes. This is my NY resolution - ignore those who ignore us. That goes for so-called "advocacy" organizations too.

Hold on... Wait a minute... Hold the phone... it gets worse because apparently that‚Äôs possible. This session was even more inaccessible than the last one. One of the exercises involved looking at pictures. I kid you not. Fucking. Pictures.

No, just lost mine :-( they were paired against different people. You can't delete a phone without a keycard and can't delete a keycard without the list key card. Major security fail. I'm waiting a week for a callback for a USB cable. I bet this ends in SC visit.

I can remember the pre-internet BBS era before ISP's (1980's). You didn't visit a website by google searching, you dialled up each one individually from their phone numbers printed in a magazine! There was only one here in Albury too lol. I'm so old...
Must you continually ejaculate such excrement! Put your phone down Don, or use it to call a good doctor...
Love to just...not be called by the phone counselling service as scheduled üôÉ luckily I have a psychologist appointment tomorrow! Things are a bit rough right now. Leaving ‚Äúmid-semester‚Äù break until 10 weeks in is not cool, ACU! I need a rest!
Actually I agree!  Get most annoyed when prompt adhoc service is demanded 4 routine care usually needing appt &amp; they think its our job to call GP etc  for info (nope. "Here's a phone, tell practice nurse to fax to xxxx xxxx") or arrange authority scripts

I get sad every time I add my weight and body fat into my phone and it keeps reminding me of how little progress I've made and how far away from my goal I am. Apparently I'm also obese according to BMI. My doctor told me that I'm not obese and BMI is useless. Who to believe!?
So the M‚Äôsian doctor at the ED saw mine &amp; Joyce‚Äôs (next of kin) phone number then said:\nWah your parents allow you 2 to have so many 4s in your phone number?\n\nI replied: this is Australia, Chinese superstition don‚Äôt work here!\n\nHe responded: that‚Äôs exactly what I told my parents.
My doctor is excellent, but to prescribe Panadeine Forte he has to get permission by phone from bureaucrats in Canberra, which is offensive. OTC Mersyndol worked better with far less codeine content but now of course you can't get it(on the PBS), forcing people into heavier stuff

Why didn't they just X-ray on the spot? When I finally went to a family doctor he ordered an immediate x-ray and ten minutes later he did a telephone referral to a surgeon while we admired the picture of my mangled bone.

I can‚Äôt get my head around how this is legal, when there is supposed to be confidentiality within the doctor/nurse, patient relationship. I‚Äôm not even allowed to share information about my patients over the phone, unless I know for sure I‚Äôm speaking to a parent or legal guardian.
